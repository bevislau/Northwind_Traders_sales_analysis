# Northwind_Traders_sales_analysis
Northwind Traders sales analysis (Project from dataquest)

Scenario
You are a Data Analyst at Northwind Traders, an international gourmet food distributor. Management is looking to you for insights to make strategic decisions in several aspects of the business. The projects focus on:

Evaluating employee performance to boost productivity,
Understanding product sales and category performance to optimize inventory and marketing strategies,
Analyzing sales growth to identify trends, monitor company progress, and make more accurate forecasts,
And evaluating customer purchase behavior to target high-value customers with promotional incentives.
Using the PostgreSQL window functions on the Northwind database, you will provide these essential insights to management, contributing significantly to the company's strategic decisions.

Database Schema
Throughout this guided project, youâ€™ll frequently need to reference the schema diagram while crafting your queries. The database schema provides an overview of the Northwind database's tables, columns, relationships, and constraints, making it an essential resource for constructing accurate and efficient SQL queries. The Northwind database has over a dozen tables, most of which we won't need for this project. We have included a modified diagram with the necessary tables below, but if you would like to refer to the original schema, you can do so here.
